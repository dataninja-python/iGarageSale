# iGarageSale
This is an express ecommerce app where one person's used stuff can be sold and become another's new treasure.

## MVP
A web app that allows users to sell items like they would with a garage sale.

## Stretch Goals
* allow people to make an offer above or below the purchase price
* allow price to move over time

##Technology Stack
* nodejs = backend javascript
* express = nodejs web framework
* ejs = html templating
* mongoDB = nosql database
* elasticsearch = search (stretch)
* jquery = simplify DOM manipuation
* stripe = payment api


## Inspiration
* amazon.com
* eBay.com
* udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-amazon-clone
    * NOTE: this course does a good job of breaking down get, post, put and delete
    * NOTE: also, breaks down building an app into good bite-sized chunks

## Challenges
* I quickly realized I lacked a firm understanding of CRUD and WHY things were 
  connected as they were in our fruits app. To resolve this, I reviewied classes and
  took the 8-hr udemy course mentioned above.

* My project is ambitious as I aim to create a store with enough functionality
  for me and others to sell unwanted items like a neighborhood garage sale. I had to
  rewrite my pseudocode several times and break things down into small chunks.
